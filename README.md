## Ahmed Hallajian

I am currently a student on the Makers Academy coding bootcamp with ambitions to learn as much as I can to prepare me for a software engineering role. I would love to work somehwere where my efforts will make an impact that I can see in the world in addition to somewhere when I can learn from other professionals who can help me grow.

I graduated from The London School of Economics and Political Science with a degree in Economics in July of 2021. After that I spent 4 months working as an assistant auditor at the National Audit Office; after deciding that a career in audit wasn't for me, I took some time out and started making YouTube videos full-time until finally I dabbled with coding and knew in an instant that I'd found exactly what it is that I want a career in.

For as long as I can remember I have been super interested in developments in technology: whether it was agonising over the specs of the latest iPhone or passionately debating Windows vs macOS, I've always had that techy spark inside of me. Now that I'm learning to code, I feel empowered to actually contribute to developments in the tech industry: an industry that is so exciting and so crucial to how the whole world functions.

## Work Experience

**YouTube** (September 2021 to Present)  
_Content Creator_

- Began uploading videos to YouTube on September 30th and produced one video a week for 8 months in a row. Grew faster than the average creator and marketed the channel on other platforms.
- Learnt to edit and colour grade videos using DaVinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro. Have gained graphic design skills while making video thumbnails.
- Gained practical filmmaking skills. These include operation and optimal use of a mirrorless camera as well as setting up audio and lighting properly. Have also greatly improved my speaking and writing skills in the process of researching and scripting each video and having to come across confident on camera.

**National Audit Office** (August 2021 to December 2021)  
_Assistant Auditor_

- Passed Assurance and Accounting ACA exams.
- Worked on high profile audits. Synthesised key analytical data using Excel.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

Making YouTube videos requires a broad variety of skills including editing, colour grading, graphic design (for thumbnails), audio design as well as softer skills like communicating conifdently on camera and being able to write engaging scripts. I learnt all of these things by doing: each video I would make I would learn something new about each skill whether it was adding exciting new transitions whilst editing or seeing in my analytics that certain introductions to my videos would have a higher audience retention for example. I paired my academic research into learning these skills with a lot of practical trial and error and I ended up making dozens of videos that were produced to a very high quality and received many comments on how much the quality of my videos had improved over the months. Other creators even reached out to me for advice on how to make videos to a similar standard. I've always been someone who is quick to pick things up: after deciding I wanted to dabble with coding in March 2022, I ended up completing Codecademy courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby and had completed at least 40 problems on codewars and I did all this within the span of a single month. A career in software development will inevitably require me to learn things quickly as technologies continue to evolve and I believe I am well-placed to thrive in such an environment.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to September 2022)
- Became fluent in using the command line and working regularly with Git/GitHub.
- Learnt Ruby to a high level, am completely familiar with syntax and have built multiple procedural programs using the language.
- Have collaborated  with other coders a lot and have frequently pair programmed to solve problems in an efficient manner. This has prepared me for a software engineering role where I expect the communication and teamwork skills I have developed to be vital. 
- OOP, TDD
- Ruby, RSpec
- Git, GitHub

#### The London School of Economics and Political Science (2018 to 2021)

- BSc Economics
- Upper Second-Class Honours
- Modules studied included Mathematical Methods, Elementary Statistical Theory and Introduction to Econometrics
- Was the Community and Welfare officer of my halls of residence in my first and second years

#### Westminster School (2011 to 2018)
