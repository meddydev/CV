## Ahmed Hallajian

I am currently a student on the Makers Academy coding bootcamp with ambitions to learn as much as I can to prepare me for a software engineering role. I would love to work somehwere where my efforts will make an impact that I can see in the world in addition to somewhere when I can learn from other professionals who can help me grow.

I graduated from The London School of Economics and Political Science with a degree in Economics in July of 2021. After that I spent 4 months working as an assistant auditor at the National Audit Office; after deciding that a career in audit wasn't for me, I took some time out and started making YouTube videos full-time until finally I dabbled with coding and knew in an instant that I'd found exactly what it is that I want a career in.

For as long as I can remember I have been super interested in developments in technology: whether it was agonising over the specs of the latest iPhone or passionately debating Windows vs macOS, I've always had that techy spark inside of me. Now that I'm learning to code, I feel empowered to actually contribute to developments in the tech industry: an industry that is so exciting and so crucial to how the whole world functions.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

## Projects

| Project                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/meddydev/fizzbuzz)**            | Program that solves the "fizzbuzz" problem | Ruby, Git, GitHub, RSpec, TDD |
| **[Student Directory]()** | Script that manages a directory of students (that can be invoked from the command line) | Ruby, Git, GitHub|

## Work Experience

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
